# True or False is returned when using relational operators which cocmpare two values.
# Equals is == and Not Equals is !=
# True and False are "bool" types
# a boolean variable is a variable set to a bool (True or False)

# Boolean operators combine smaller boolean expressions into a single exxpression.

	and
		combines two boolean expressions and evaluates as True only if both expressions are True
	or
		combines two boolean expressions and evaluates as True as long as one of the expressions is true
	not
